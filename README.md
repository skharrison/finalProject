# Structural Variant Analysis GUI

* Repo containing a java swing GUI built specifically for analyzing components of our structural variant calling/validation pipeline. Made for bioinformatics advanced programming final project at UNCC. 
* GUI contains three tools: IGV Displayer, Compute Coverage, and Color Sample Table. Each tool is described below. 

### IGV Displayer 


### Compute Coverage

### Color Sample Table 

Input a table containing the variants, all samples, and normalized coverage values. Given a choice of highlighting color (with default color yellow), the tool highlights samples that have the specific variant.
